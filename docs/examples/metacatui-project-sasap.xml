**Salmon connect Alaska’s ecosystems, cultures and economies**

Salmon and people have thrived in Alaska for millennia and today are increasingly under pressure from both local and global factors. To help inform looming future decisions, the State of Alaska’s Salmon and People (SASAP) project brought together Indigenous and non-Indigenous salmon experts from academia, management agencies, and non-governmental organizations. Together, they provide a holistic assessment of the current state of the complex and dynamic salmon-and-people system in Alaska.

---

# Our Process

Central to the SASAP process is a deliberate emphasis on collaboration between
Indigenous knowledge and Western science perspectives to gather and synthesize
information that tells the true story of Alaska’s salmon and people.

To foster the multidisciplinary, cross-cultural dialogue necessary to sustain
salmon populations, the SASAP project incorporated the ‘Working Group’ model
developed by lead partner [NCEAS](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu).

Each of eight SASAP working groups came together for short periods of time over
two years, in Alaska and at the NCEAS headquarters in Alaska, to collaborate
on specific issues related to salmon and people in Alaska. Each group was
composed of between 12 and 24 knowledge experts from a range of disciplines,
backgrounds, and regions. Participants brought his or her data and experiences
for synthesis and analysis, while NCEAS offered logistical and technical support
to facilitate their innovation.

![Research roadmap](urn:uuid:5d46326c-0ca1-4ce8-a580-b0e598f76a00)

By tapping into broad perspectives, and with thorough analyses across multiple
data sources, SASAP working groups were able to: 1) identify and describe the
current state of knowledge of salmon in Alaska, 2) discover key gaps in
knowledge, and 3) reveal untapped opportunities in the evidence.

The diverse, collaborative, and supported working groups are an especially
effective way to catalyze collaboration between Indigenous knowledge, Western
science perspectives, and the many types of Alaskan, national, and global
organizations with relevant salmon expertise.

# Making it happen

## Statewide Knowledge Synthesis Groups

At the onset of the SASAP project, several Working Groups were tasked with
documenting the state of knowledge in three fundamental areas of Alaska’s salmon
systems: salmon distribution and habitat, sociocultural and socio-economic
dimensions of salmon systems, and governance decisions leading to current
management programs. The work of these groups are synthesized into 13 Regional
Chapters sections.

![Working group](urn:uuid:97be2462-43af-4f4e-9eba-74c6e01a555e)

## Special Topics Groups

An additional five Special Topics Working Groups were selected to focus on
specific research questions that provide insight into the pressures on salmon
and salmon communities as well as options for response to those pressures. Each
of the Special Topic’s group findings are presented separately in the Special
Topics section.

Together, SASAP’s eight Working Groups engaged a wide range of experts and
stakeholders to improve the ecological understanding, management, and social
sustainability of Alaskan salmon systems.

## Disentangling Data: The Data Task Force

An essential component of the SASAP working group process was the support
each group received from a team of geospatial analysis experts from NCEAS.
The Data Task Force team coordinated data requests from Alaska Department of
Fish and Game and other agencies and organizations, then worked to reformat,
integrate, and run quality control on those datasets.  Importantly, the
interactive graphs, figures, and infograms generated by the Task Force greatly
enhanced the ability of users to visualize the often complex information about
Alaska salmon.

# Looking Ahead

## A Roadmap for the Future of Salmon

**Over one hundred salmon experts spent more than two years on intensive multidisciplinary, cross-cultural research and analysis of Alaskan salmon — and the people and natural systems that depend upon them.**

In November 2018, leaders from the eight SASAP Working Groups, along with
external funders and scientists, gathered at the NCEAS headquarters in Santa
Barbara to reflect on the knowledge gained from this unique collaborative effort
 to identify and prioritize future research directions for Alaska salmon.

The group applied three different lenses to considering what we know (and what
 we don’t!) about the Alaska salmon ecosystem: 1) a topical or disciplinary
 approach; 2) a place-based approach, and 3) a futures-thinking approach.

The intended audiences for the emerging research agenda include not only the
research community but also private and public funders, state and federal
policymakers (especially those who set funding policy), Alaska communities and
the broader public, conservation practitioners, and industry.

# Regions Overview

The story of Alaska’s salmon and people is rooted in place. It is only by
understanding the differences among regions that one can see the connections
that unite all Alaskans to salmon.

The thirteen SASAP regions were determined based on their geography, and in
many cases, represent large watersheds where all falling water flows into the
same ocean location. Moreover, regions tend to be grouped by Indigenous
cultures and languages, evidence of the deep-time ties between Alaska’s salmon
and people. Some regions align with current ADF&G statistical areas; some do not.

# Arctic

### Statement:

The Arctic is warming at the fastest rate of any region of Alaska, yet is still
the coldest area [@temperature]. A lack of consistent monitoring and an unfamiliarity of local
people with many of the species of salmon make it difficult to know whether salmon
numbers are increasing.

![Temperature](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3A2ec06dd4-227d-46b3-87aa-a25af0140eaf)

### Summary:

We do not know whether the abundance of salmon is increasing in the Arctic,
despite increasing use of salmon by local people. The consistent subsistence
harvests of chum salmon (primarily) followed by pink salmon support the evidence that these species are established in the region, but this too is unknown. As the climate warms, it is likely that more rivers will become suitable to spawning salmon, however, the current temperatures during the summer growing months for are not yet favorable for rapid growth. In addition to freshwater conditions, populations of salmon can only become self-sustaining and rooted in place if they are able to successfully migrate back and forth to the ocean. Currently it is unknown whether the Chukchi Sea region of the Arctic Ocean is conducive to juvenile salmon survival.

# Kotzebue

### Statement:

Although a significant component of local subsistence harvests, there is no annual harvest monitoring program for salmon in the Kotzebue District.

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3Aeb030374-901d-4be4-a1be-4c655609b83b" width="800" />

### Summary:

Based upon comprehensive household harvest surveys, salmon make up about 13% of subsistence harvests by residents of the communities of the Kotzebue District; land mammals (36%), fish other than salmon (35%), and marine mammals (12%) make up the bulk of the subsistence harvests in this area [@subsistence_csis]. From 1994 through 2016, the subsistence harvest of salmon in the Kotzebue District averaged 69,188 fish. Chum salmon comprised 93% of this harvest, followed by coho (3%), pink (2%), sockeye (1%), and Chinook (<1%).

---


# Norton Sound

### Statement

Increases in chum salmon and pink salmon abundance in recent years may in part offset the loss of Chinook salmon for salmon-dependent people [@total_abundance].

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3Ac47a367b-4731-4a39-958f-7cd1b225992a" width="800" />

### Summary

Although among the smaller regions, nearly 5,000 km of Norton Sound streams and rivers are known to contain at least one species of salmon. However, only a few locations are known to produce sockeye salmon, given the lack of large lakes this species needs for rearing juveniles. Conditions favoring increases in chum salmon have been observed in recent years. The region has a long western history of mining (70 mines are still apparent on the landscape) which contributes to the third highest human footprint across the state. Habitat connectivity is potentially a problem with 90% of the known 104 culverts potentially impacting fish passage.

---


# Yukon

### Statement

Historically the largest subsistence salmon fishery in Alaska, Chinook runs are declining and have created management challenges and lower harvests [@subsistence_salmon].

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3A02efb76f-ee89-4fd7-aff3-9253a2aba19d" width="800" />

### Summary

Yukon River drainage subsistence salmon harvests have been historically the largest in Alaska. Since the mid-1990s, the abundance of Yukon River salmon stocks has fluctuated and subsistence harvests have declined. Consequences of reduced subsistence harvests linked to weak salmon runs and restricted fisheries include increased fishing costs, decreased earnings from commercial salmon fisheries, fewer fish wheels, increased drifting, decreased fish camp use, increased difficulties obtaining subsistence foods, maintaining dog teams without salmon as a food source which results in decreased use of sled dogs, and increased constraints on subsistence fishing from the need to engage in wage employment.

---


# Kuskokwim

### Statement
Combined efforts to reduce harvest of depressed returns of Chinook salmon came at a great societal cost in the region, yet the efforts are apparently working as the abundance of salmon is rebuilding [@total_abundance].

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3A0fe271c0-042b-4c7f-93ee-b6fdb0c99ff2" width="800" />

### Summary
The decline of total abundance of Chinook salmon – the most culturally important species of the region – was the catalyst that accelerated the rise of new management frameworks and partnerships. Through reduced harvest by local users, the Chinook salmon resource has begun to rebuild. Greatly reduced harvest has helped increase the number of potential spawning individuals (i.e., escapement). The rapid rise of other species such as sockeye salmon have, at least in part, mitigated the loss of Chinook salmon but is not a perfect replacement. The salmon-producing habitat of the Kuskokwim is diverse and productive. Compared to the neighboring Bristol Bay region, the Kuskokwim is drier and is categorized by more burned area by forest fires than other regions (the Yukon excepted).

# Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands

### Statement

Integration of commercial and subsistence fishing is notable in these management areas, and reflected in how subsistence allocations have been defined by the BOF.

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3Ad252f0c0-8fa2-4dad-b190-7ab8c07759e2" width="800" />


### Summary

The most recent comprehensive household surveys show that salmon provide 58% of the total wild resource harvests for home use in the Alaska Peninsula – Aleutian Islands Management Area. Integration of commercial and subsistence fishing is quite pronounced in communities of the Alaska Peninsula. Commercial gear is regularly used in support of subsistence fishing and hunting. In recognition that a substantial portion of the salmon for home use for communities in these management areas comes from sources other than the subsistence fishery, the BOFs’ ANS findings are based upon subsistence permit returns and estimated harvests from commercial removal and with rod and reel recorded on comprehensive household surveys.

# Chignik

### Statement

The Chignik region has experienced multiple changes in recent years including population decline [@census] and commercial fleet restructuring.

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3A41c3682b-066b-4954-8696-608da56afd59" width="800" />


### Summary

The population of the region has seen a 31% decline from 518 in 1990 to 362 in 2010. The Chignik commercial salmon fishery underwent a fundamental fleet restructuring with a cooperative system in place from 2002-2005. Subsistence harvests of salmon in the Chignik area are affected by multidimensional factors, including stock abundance and run timing, weather cycles, fuel and gear costs, employment opportunities, commercial salmon prices, and access to traditional knowledge. Fishing experiences at lodges in the region for visiting tourists are also popular.

---


# Kodiak

### Statement

Though relatively small as a region, Kodiak is the 4th largest salmon producing area of Alaska [@total_abundance].

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn:uuid:054342bf-6322-4551-be3c-3a57c169273d" width="800" />

### Summary

Kodiak is the 4th largest salmon producing region of Alaska with habitat most well suited to pink salmon (short coastal streams) and sockeye salmon (suitable rearing lakes). The region has a temperate, and some may say temperamental, climate characterized by wet, cool, and windy summers and winters. High human density on the east side of the island near the hub of Kodiak results in the 4th highest index of human footprints among regions. Approximately half of the known culverts on the island are known to or have the potential to negatively affect fish passage. Though among the smaller regions of Alaska, Kodiak has approximately 2700 km (1677 miles) of streams and rivers known to contain at least one species of Pacific salmon. The region has a long history of lake fertilization and hatchery enhancement aimed to bolster adult salmon returns.

---


# Bristol Bay

### Statement

Even though Bristol Bay harvest is second in volume to Southeast, its historical revenue is twice the size of revenue generated by Southeast salmon fisheries [@earnings].

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3Ace35602e-bb37-4aa2-ab26-028fa30513b0" width="800" />


### Summary

About one third of Bristol Bay fishermen and two-thirds of Bristol Bay processing workers live in Washington, Oregon, and California. In order to illustrate the ripple effect of the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery, in 2010, the harvest value associated with 29 million sockeye salmon being caught was $165 million. Salmon processing added another $225 million to this value for a total wholesale value of $390 million. The total value of Bristol Bay seafood exports in that year was $250 million, which amounted to about 6% of the total U.S. seafood export.

---


# Copper River

### Statement

Connected by road to Alaska’s population centers, subsistence and personal use salmon fisheries have grown rapidly [@subsistence_salmon], raising concerns among local residents.

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3A7421e9b9-7c0d-4feb-80cc-ec4c43d4fac2" width="800" />

### Summary

In 2018, multiple sets of regulations governed subsistence and personal use fishing in the Copper River. A personal use dip net fishery occurred at Chitina, while subsistence fisheries took place in the Glennallen Subdistrict and near Cordova. In all Copper River fisheries combined from 1989 to 2016, 96% of the harvest was sockeye salmon. Since the 1970s, steady growth occurred in the upper Copper River fisheries (Figure). The growth of nonlocal participation in the Glennallen Subdistrict subsistence fishery and the Chitina personal use fishery has raised concerns among local residents, including Indigenous Ahtna Athabascan communities, regarding competition for fish and fishing sites.

---


# Cook Inlet

### Statement

Cook Inlet’s commercial salmon fisheries are the state’s third largest in value and extensive participation in personal use and sport fisheries underscore the political complexity of the region.

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3A13c6bd56-297c-4a55-8d28-d722fb99ba4d" width="800" />

### Summary

The potential for large revenue comes at a cost, because fishing revenue variability in this region has been greater than anywhere else in the Gulf of Alaska. Cook Inlet has the most diverse set of salmon users in the state, including commercial, sport, subsistence, and personal use fishers. Historically, the largest catch volume has gone to the commercial salmon fleet, followed by sportfish, subsistence, and personal use [@harvest_all_sectors]. Since 1995, the total volume of fish allocated to personal use, subsistence, and sport fishing has been relatively stable, ranging between 5 and 15 million lbs/year.

---


# Prince William Sound

### Statement

No other region of state is as tied to hatchery enhancement as Prince William Sound.

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn%3Auuid%3Ad5ded097-e0cd-4db5-a300-6f9a334105dd" width="800" />

### Summary

Nearly ¾ of a billion salmon are released in this region with the majority being pink salmon, followed by chum salmon and sockeye salmon [@hatchery_returns]. Returning adults are integral components of the fishery, where in some years the entire catch of some species can be the result of hatchery production. Concerns of negative legacy effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill remain, though recent evidence points to a stronger role of large scale changes in the ocean. For some species, potential competitive interactions with large numbers of wild and hatchery individuals are a primary determinant of salmon productivity, rather than the oil spill.

---


# Southeast

### Statement

Maintaining connections of rivers to their floodplains will provide options for spawning and rearing salmon and is a tangible way to respond to changing climates.

<img src="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/urn:uuid:cd1d5c2d-e1e4-4942-8341-71c35d004243" width="800" />

### Summary

Southeast Alaska is a veritable wild fish factory and is by far the most rich in terms of total salmon abundance [@total_abundance]. An average of over 75 million total salmon return and are caught here each year. The vast majority of the fish caught are wild pink salmon. Adult chum salmon abundance is bolstered by the release of hundreds of millions of juvenile salmon from hatcheries. The landscape is dominated by coastal rainforests kept moist by seemingly constant rainfall. Although future changes in precipitation are unclear, maintaining connections of rivers to their floodplains will provide options for spawning and rearing salmon and helps salmon respond to a rapidly changing climate.
